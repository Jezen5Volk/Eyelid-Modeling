    "There are three different model architectures that I think would be important to explore for the purposes of this project: RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs. In addition to these model architectures, it is worth pointing out that the data I have is not surface EMG data but data collected by needles inserted into the obicularis muscle. This means that there is finer resolution into picking up signals from individual motor units, which means that it is possible that there is enough information captured in the rectified EMG signal to recreate eyelid motions, without adding a pre-processing step to aquire the spectral form of the data. The ultimate goal is performance, which means that it is worth testing the model architectures with rectified EMG inputs vs spectral encoding, as well as if there is extra time, a combined model architecture which would accept spectral and rectified EMG. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**: Since the desired application is a real-time model of eyelid kinematics directly informed by the EMG behavior of the obicularis muscle, we need to break our data into windows. Thus, window length and window stride will end up being hyperparameters that we optimize for with Ray Tune, and for simplicity we'll use 'same' padding. This means that our input to the model will actually be of shape $X \\in R^{L \\times N_w \\times N_b \\times C}$ where $L$ is the length of our window, $N_w$ is the number of windows in a batch, $N_b$ is the number of examples in a batch, and $C$ is the number of channels present in the data (in this case, 5). Once the data is windowed, the next step in preprocessing is to either identify the frquency spectrum or to rectify the data. Finally, a 2d batchnorm step will be taken to set the input data to each channel to unit statistics. \n",
